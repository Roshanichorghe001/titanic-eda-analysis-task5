## 📝 Summary of Analysis
Key insights from the Titanic dataset:

- **Women survived more than men**  
- **1st class passengers had the highest survival rate**  
- **3rd class passengers had the lowest survival rate**  
- **Children (0–15 years) had better survival chances**  
- **Higher ticket fare resulted in higher survival probability**  
- **Age shows weak correlation with survival, Fare shows positive correlation**

More details are available inside the notebook and PDF report.
